# Modeling Resources
This respository is a storage vehicle for actual resources, links to resources, and commentary on modeling. I will try to keep the repository semi-organized.

## Workshops

### FAS-GSO Workshop 10-04-2023 - Introduction to Modeling
The powerpoint slides and ANOVA simulation using examples from Kéry (2010) showcases using glmmTMB and emmeans in a simple one-way and two-way ANOVA as well as lightly touches on doing ANOVAs with different distributional assumptions.

## External Resources

### Introduction to WinBUGS for Ecologists, Kéry 2010 (the blue book)
This is a foundational book, buy a copy if you can, but there is an [online PDF here](http://www.biometrica.tomsk.ru/lib/kery.pdf) but also in the Introduction to WinBUGS folder. The original datafiles can be found [here](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/modx/de/projekte/publikationen/bpa/complete-code-and-data-files-of-the-book) Also in that folder is the original [BUGS code](https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/software/kerybook/) and [JAGS code](https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/software/kerybook/Code_Kery2010_with_JAGS.R) as an R script. The Swiss Hare dataset (only one used in the book) is also available in the folder. 

### Bayesian Population Analysis using WinBUGS, Kéry and Schaub 2012 (the red book)
The followup to the blue book, this is another amazing resource for quantitative ecology. Not aware of a PDF version. In the Bayesian Population Analysis folder, there is the [BUGS code](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/modx/downloads/files/publications/BPA/bpa-code.txt) and [JAGS code](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/modx/de/projekte/publikationen/bpa/code-for-running-bpa-using-jags) while all datafiles can be found [here](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/modx/de/projekte/publikationen/bpa/complete-code-and-data-files-of-the-book) or in the zip file in the folder.
